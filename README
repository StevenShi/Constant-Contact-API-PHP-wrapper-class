------------------INTRO-------------------

ConstantContact.php is a wrapper class for the Constant Contact API (www.constantcontact.com).  This class will provide you with methods that will simplify the usage of the supplied api's.  At the moment the class provides methods for retriving the URL's of all previous sent email campaigns, as well as the ability to add new users into a contact list.

------------------EXAMPLE-------------------

*get list of previously sent emails
$cc = new ConstantContact( 'your_api_key', 'login_name', 'password' );
$result = $cc->getListOfPreviousSentEmails();

*add user to mailing list
$cc = new ConstantContact( 'your_api_key', 'login_name', 'password' );
$result = $cc->addContactToMailingList("michael@mikesvendsen.net", "https://api.constantcontact.com/ws/customers/'login_name'/'the_list_number'");

**
replace:
-your_api_key w/ the api key provided to you from constant contact
-login_name w/ your login name
-password w/ your password
-the_list_number w/ the number of the contact list that you would like to add a contact to
